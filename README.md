# CUDA Implementation of a Three Layer Neural Network.

# Introduction
This is a CUDA implementation of one forward and backward propagation for a three layer neural network. The code is just a documentation of my understanding how neural networks work. The cuda implementation for any number of layers for the neural network will be done in the future.  

# Run code
The code will prompt you for the number of features for the input data, the number of training data, the number of neurons in the first layer, second layer and third layer. The number of neuron in the third layer should always be one since the code is structured for only binary classification.
